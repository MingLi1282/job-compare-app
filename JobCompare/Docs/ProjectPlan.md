# Project Plan


**Author**: Team 158

## 1 Introduction

George Burdell is in the market for a new job and wants us to design an Android app with which he can compare jobs across different features like salary, location, cost of living, etc.
In this document, we shall describe the process of developing this application.
## 2 Process Description

- Inception
  - 
  - In the inception phase, we will document the core project requirements, features and constraints. 
  We will also generate use-case models to get a better understanding of the system. 
  In general, this phase delimits the project scope, presents the business case for the product and gives us a vision for the end product. 
  - Input Requirements: Project Requirements, Constraints like what environments this app can be run on, i.e. Android or iOS, Key features, e.g. being able to compare two jobs, setting user preferences
  - Output Requirements: Deliverables: Vision Document, initial-use case model, initial project glossary and business case, initial project plan
- Elaboration
  - 
  - In the elaboration phase, we will analyze the problem domain, establish architecture, address most critical use cases, refine plan of activities. We will also complete the use-case model and add supplementary requirements.
  - Input Requirements: Project Requirements, Vision Document, use case model
  - Output Requirements: Stable Architecture and vision, Almost complete use-case model, supplementary requirements, Design document, Testing Plan
- Construction 
  - 
  - This is the phase in which all the development occurs. This is also the phase in which the features and system is tested. Crucially, by the end of this we should have an application that approximates towards the app that George Burdell envisions.
  - Input Requirements: Project Requirements, Stable architecture and vision, Testing Plan, Design Doc
  - Output Requirements: All use cases realized,  complete system test results, user manual, complete set of artifacts
- Transition
  - 
  - This is the phase in which we handle issues after deployment. This come from bug reports, feature requests, or changing requirements. 
  - Input Requirements: application that can be distributed and run
  - Output Requirements: Complete project with all artifacts, product in use, lessons learnt
